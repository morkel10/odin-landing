<h1>Spectrum is planning to drop 22 channels, including Corncob TV.
</h1>

<h2>
    They're saying by the end of 2022 Corncob TV
    won't be available on your cable menu. 
    That means you won't be able to see some of your favourite Corncob TV shows,
    including <strong>Coffin Flop</strong>. 
    They're saying they want to drop Corncob TV because we showed over 400 naked dead bodies on our show, <strong>Coffin Flop</strong>. 
    If you love Corncob TV shows it's time to tell Spectrum...

    <p class="big-quote-text"><i>I don't know what to tell ya, bud! We're just shooting funerals and showing the ones where the bodies fly out. 
        They're saying, "No way. You must've rigged something." 
        I didn't do fucking shit. I didn't rig shit! I've been waiting a long time for a hit on Corncob TV. 
        I DIDN'T FUCKING DO THIS! They're saying we don't have permissions of the family. 
        I said we don't need permissions of the family. We're allowed to show 'em nude 'cause they ain't got no soul! 
        The guys at Spectrum think I'm just some dumb hick. They said that to me at a dinner. 
        Call Spectrum and say, "I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT! I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANY OF THIS! THERE'S WORSE SHIT ON THE LOCAL NEWS!"</i></p>
